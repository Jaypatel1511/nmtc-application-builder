## [1.0.0] — 2025-05-09

Initial public release. Four weeks of development, 544 tests passing.

### Added

**Week 1 — Core Foundation**
- `Pipeline` and `PipelineProject` classes with CSV ingestion and 20-project sample data
- `CDEProfile` class with YAML loading and sample data
- `Application` orchestration class — single entry point for all functionality
- Eligibility validation, completeness check, and consistency check
- Readiness scoring (0–100, grades A–D) across 5 weighted dimensions
- NMTC eligibility enrichment via `nmtc-mapper` with offline fallback
- Deal economics computation via `nmtc-calc` with manual fallback
- `PipelineAnalyzer` — distress, geographic, sector, and impact sub-analyses

**Week 2 — Output Renderers**
- `WordApplicationBuilder` — full NMTC application draft in `.docx`
- `ExcelApplicationBuilder` — multi-sheet workbook with dashboard, pipeline, and impact tables
- `PDFApplicationBuilder` — formatted PDF via ReportLab
- `MarkdownApplicationBuilder` — clean Markdown output for version control workflows
- Shared `styles.py` color palette and typography constants used across all renderers
- `Application.generate()` — produces all four formats in one call

**Week 3 — Intelligence Layer**
- `WinProbabilityModel` — 5-dimensional alignment scoring against CY2020–2024 winner patterns
- `HistoricalBenchmarks` — 9-metric tier comparison with methodology disclosure
- `RecommendationEngine` — quantified, prioritized improvement actions per dimension
- `PipelineOptimizer` — greedy construction + swap-based local search, no LP/MIP solver
- `OptimizationConstraints` — QEI budget, state diversity, sector, and eligibility constraints
- `analyze_winning_patterns()` and `compare_to_winners()` for pattern analysis
- Three executed example notebooks demonstrating full workflow

**Week 4 — Polish + Distribution**
- `nmtcapp.visualization` module — 5 publication-quality chart functions (300 DPI PNG)
  - `plot_pipeline_map` — project distribution on continental US map
  - `plot_distress_heatmap` — QEI by state with distress-level color coding
  - `plot_sector_distribution` — sector mix vs. winner patterns
  - `plot_readiness_radar` — 5-dimensional radar vs. competitive benchmark
  - `plot_winner_alignment` — pipeline metrics vs. winner p25/p50/p75
- `nmtcapp.cli` — `nmtcapp init`, `nmtcapp analyze`, `nmtcapp version` commands
- `templates/` — `pipeline_template.csv`, `pipeline_sample_strong.csv`,
  `pipeline_sample_weak.csv`, `cde_profile_template.yaml`, `cde_profile_sample.yaml`
- MkDocs documentation site with 13 pages deployed to GitHub Pages
- Streamlit interactive demo app (4 pages: Analyzer, Scorer, Optimizer, Methodology)
- Polished README with badges, architecture diagram, and honest limitations
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CITATION.cff`
- GitHub issue and PR templates
- Version bumped to 1.0.0; PyPI classifiers updated to Production/Stable

### Fixed

- `objectives.py` — distress scoring used wrong level strings (`"deep_distressed"` →
  `"deep"`, `"severely_distressed"` → `"severe"`), causing distress score to always be 0
- `sector_analysis.py` — `max_single_sector_pct` was missing from output dict, causing
  `win_probability._score_sector` to always apply a maximum concentration penalty (score = 0)
- `nmtc_mapper_adapter.py` — suppressed nmtcmapper's raw `print()` 404 messages using
  `contextlib.redirect_stdout`
- `pipeline_optimizer.py` — added no-regression guarantee: reverts to full pipeline if
  optimized subset scores lower than input
- `test_optimizer.py` — `test_eligible_only_filters` was mutating shared `_SAMPLE_PROJECTS`
  objects, causing cross-test `is_nmtc_eligible` contamination
